This work requires an instance of the DSS to be running. 
To run the DSS locally:

1: Start Docker
2: Clone an instance of the DSS (clone from here: https://github.com/interuss/dss)
3: Within the local repo, navigate to dss/build/dev. 
4: Run this command in terminal:
    % sudo ./run_locally.sh up

    NB: to stop it run:
    control + c

    To remove it completely from docker run:
    % sudo ./run_locally.sh down


This project contains 7 subdirectories. 

Open the Tests directory.

Open app.py and run it as Python: Flask

This will create a web application:
http://127.0.0.1:5000
If you navigate to this url you will see:
“Welcome to the AirspaceLink InterUSS Web Application”

Navigate to:
http://127.0.0.1:5000/route_map to get the interactive map. To edit this webpage in VSCODE, you'll find the file /Tests/templates/index.html, with all the javascript that runs that page.

To expose this to outside of localhost, you need ngrok.

Install ngrok via Homebrew with the following command:
brew install ngrok/ngrok/ngrok

Run the following command to add your authtoken to the default ngrok.yml configuration file. You should log into NGROK for the next part so you can get the correct authtoken:

ngrok config add-authtoken <token>

Deploy your app online:

Ephemeral Domain
Put your app online at ephemeral domain Forwarding to your upstream service. For example, if it is listening on port http://localhost:8080, run:
ngrok http http://localhost:8080

so in our case we run:
ngrok http http://127.0.0.1:5000

When you run it you will be given a display
ngrok                                                                                                                    (Ctrl+C to quit)
